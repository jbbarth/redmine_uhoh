Redmine UhOh plugin
===================

This plugin is a shameless adaptation of (Ryan Bates' Railscast #277 about mountable engines)[http://railscasts.com/episodes/277]. Basically it uses Rails notifications mechanism to keep track of exceptions that happen in the app and build a clean UI to display them.
