Redmine UhOh plugin
===================

This plugin is a shameless adaptation of [Ryan Bates' Railscast #277 about mountable engines](http://railscasts.com/episodes/277). Basically it uses Rails notifications mechanism to keep track of exceptions that happen in the app and build a clean UI to display them.
